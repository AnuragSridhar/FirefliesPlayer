1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,110
what's the hardest thing about doing

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,240
business today for one thing your

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,529
customers have so many more options with

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,210
the touch of a button they can choose to

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,710
go somewhere else they're also very

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,150
knowledgeable sixty percent of the

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,700
buying decision is already made before

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,529
they even come approach you what that

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,210
means is the way you understand and

10
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,430
manage your customer experience is gonna

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,410
be key to whether you win or lose a

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,510
business unfortunately as our

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,580
organizations grow larger the farther

14
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,740
removed we are from our customers hi

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,929
everyone I'm Chris Romani co-founder and

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,969
CEO at Firefly's AI and we're tackling

17
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,920
this specific problem with our customer

18
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,600
intelligence platform which will align

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,370
each and every person inside your

20
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,649
organization around the voice of the

21
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,680
customer and we do this by unlocking

22
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,510
your customer conversations 92% of all

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,129
b2b customer interactions happen through

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,050
the phone today what that means it's an

25
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,879
opportunity for you to understand what

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,710
your customers want why they need it and

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,989
how to best deliver that experience so

28
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,670
there is a direct correlation from these

29
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,770
conversations to your ability to close

30
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,780
deals drive demand gen build the right

31
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,340
product and ultimately generate revenue

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,930
for your org this is such a core

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
function so we wanted to know what

34
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,630
existing companies were doing today we

35
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,820
partnered with a group at Harvard

36
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,799
Business School and ran a survey and we

37
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,479
were surprised to see that 68% of these

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,340
companies didn't have any processes in

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,759
place to track customer insights from

40
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,229
their calls 68% and yet many of them

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,750
said most of the critical information

42
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,310
needed to navigate the entire customer

43
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,380
journey were buried inside these

44
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,600
conversations but only a fraction of it

45
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,939
was being brought back into their ERP

46
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,829
systems and CRM so the first thing we

47
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,140
believed in building out this customer

48
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,299
intelligence platform was by up leveling

49
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,670
reps and solving this problem right here

50
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,770
so the first product we released is an

51
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,229
AI assistant named Fred I'll join your

52
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,070
sales and customer facing calls and

53
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,350
automatically generate meeting notes

54
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,930
we're able to do that because of the

55
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,490
custom data models we've built and then

56
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,200
augmented neural network that gets

57
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,479
smarter based on the semantics of the

58
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,030
conversations that are happening but for

59
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,710
the reps the magic is they're able to

60
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,840
get bullet point notes automatically

61
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,939
route it in to their CRM and this

62
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,860
completely eliminates the whole data

63
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,810
entry hassle lets them focus on more

64
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,060
deals and spend more time with customers

65
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,580
helping solve their issues by choosing

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,110
this go to market approach where we're

67
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,430
providing a solution that

68
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,380
reps can directly plug into their

69
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,750
workflow without anyone else's help

70
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,750
we've been able to spread rapidly at the

71
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,090
grassroots to give you an example we had

72
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,340
one person at a company in Atlanta

73
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,770
Georgia using fireflies within two weeks

74
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,720
we had 29 people at that company using

75
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,610
fireflies and eight other companies were

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,140
on Atlanta we're using it now if you

77
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,250
fast forward two months we triple the

78
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,500
number of people in Atlanta that we're

79
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,730
using fireflies and this core group of

80
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,560
users were now sharing it with their

81
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,140
friends in New York Boston Texas

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,780
Washington and back to California we

83
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,060
were spreading like a consumer company

84
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,440
and 82% of our new customers come

85
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,170
through referrals from existing

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,030
customers this is also wonderful for our

87
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,220
larger enterprise business strategy

88
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,320
where once fireflies spreads inside an

89
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,959
organization we can go to management and

90
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,720
tell them look fireflies is now your

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,400
eyes and ears in front of your customers

92
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,350
and it's able to sift through millions

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,080
of conversations let us bring those

94
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,110
insights back to your organization with

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,459
our customer intelligence platform and

96
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,540
for example you'll have the sales team

97
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,850
that's having these great conversations

98
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,220
with prospects that's really converting

99
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,110
and now with fireflies you can send

100
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,400
those exact insights back to marketing

101
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,410
so that they can create better

102
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,720
collateral and align their campaigns

103
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,519
around these sort of conversations

104
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,650
customer success might be getting

105
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,290
inundated with feature requests and

106
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,660
complaints the product team is siloed

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,430
off a bit and they're building their own

108
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,260
roadmap so now with this sort of

109
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,850
insights being sent straight to product

110
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,290
the engineering roadmap is going to be

111
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,019
better aligned with business objectives

112
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,340
we even have this unique instance where

113
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,890
we were working with a customer and

114
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,600
their legal team wanted to know when

115
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,130
topics around GDP are what were being

116
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,739
discussed they were releasing a new

117
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,150
product and a lot of their customers had

118
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,610
issues around this new law that was

119
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,709
coming out in Europe around gdpr and so

120
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,060
the legal team which is usually so far

121
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,730
removed from the customers with a touch

122
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,620
of a button is able to connect and is

123
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,780
able to understand get contextual

124
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,709
insights and help make sure that that

125
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,959
customer experience

126
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,489
is taken care of we're empowering every

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,979
person in the organization to put the

128
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,769
customer first and providing them the

129
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,630
opportunity to be around the voice of

130
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,240
the customer this is something that's

131
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,770
really deep for both my co-founder Sam

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,790
and myself because we've worked at

133
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,890
larger organizations

134
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,080
how large this gap is and by even

135
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,690
augmenting it a little bit we approve

136
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,220
sales execution and drive business

137
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,350
functions a whole lot better and this

138
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,050
sort of technology does no longer have

139
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,610
to remain just in places like MIT

140
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,100
research labs where we're coming from

141
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,660
right this with the right sort of talent

142
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,930
machine learning expertise and domain

143
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,190
focus we can build tangible business

144
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,020
applications we have a unique

145
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,370
opportunity to become category creators

146
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,050
and what some would call a relatively

147
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,640
new space that's blooming customer

148
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,290
experience management it's an eight

149
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,540
billion dollar market but what's most

150
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,310
interesting for me is it's growing 17%

151
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,920
year over year for nearly the past

152
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,870
decade it's no longer about sales or

153
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,200
just marketing or customer success it's

154
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,130
about customer experience we definitely

155
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,870
have our work cut out for ourselves

156
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,670
right now we're focusing on the US

157
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,790
market english-speaking market

158
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,530
specifically high tech b2b SAS but we

159
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,440
have our eye set in the next two years

160
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,810
on how we can leverage this in larger

161
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,280
industries - like finance healthcare and

162
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,830
law enforcement because in many of these

163
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,750
industries recording conversations is

164
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,950
required by law but no one is unlocking

165
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,750
any of the potential from those

166
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,160
conversations afterwards we think we can

167
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,100
go in there build custom models and

168
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,660
tackle that for them we're also thinking

169
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
about our infrastructure from the way we

170
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,720
build our neural network and deep

171
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,670
learning stack today to where we want to

172
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,750
be 18 months 24 months or now it's no

173
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,970
longer just about English anymore

174
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,040
there's a global opportunity out there

175
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,720
and we want to build ourselves up so

176
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,210
that we can potentially partner with

177
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,010
providers for example Baidu and then go

178
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,390
along to the Chinese market that would

179
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,210
be massive for us in terms of how we

180
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,240
execute ultimately we want to become a

181
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,890
global company and help our customers

182
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,630
build the world's most customer centric

183
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,140
companies for their customers using

184
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,140
